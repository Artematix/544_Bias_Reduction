This is a project on bias mitigation in classical and deep learning machine learning models, working with a diabetes 30 day hospital readmission dataset.

Since multiple methods are tested and implemented, in order to go through the code you must run files in the order indicated by their label.

Possibly, test and validation .csv files must be duplicated, though all CSV's are already included, so data preparation pipeline steps can be skipped.

Each step is slightly different with varied hyperparameters, etc. Much of the code has been iterated on and replaced, so the original grid searches for example are no longer there, since I found near-optimal parameters and did not wish to go through the grid search each time.

The final analysis contains many interesting results to look at, as well as base_data_preparation and base_feature_selection. Take a look :)
